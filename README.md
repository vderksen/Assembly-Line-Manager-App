# Assembly-Line-Manager-App

C++ project simulates an assembly line that fills customer orders from inventory. The app reads from the file the list of the item that needs to be filled. Each station on the line holds the inventory of items for filling customer orders. As order moves down on the line it became complete or incomplete if needed items are out the stock. At the end of processing, the line manager lists the completed orders and orders that are incomplete.
